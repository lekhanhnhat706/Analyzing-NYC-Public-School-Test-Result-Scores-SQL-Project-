1. Inspecting the data
-- Select all columns from the database
-- Display only the first ten rows

SELECT * 
FROM schools
LIMIT 10;

2. Finding missing values
-- Count rows with percent_tested missing and total number of schools

SELECT
    COUNT(*) - COUNT (percent_tested) AS num_tested_missing,
    COUNT (*) AS num_schools
FROM schools

3. Schools by building code
-- Count the number of unique building_code values
SELECT
    COUNT (DISTINCT building_code) AS num_school_buildings
FROM schools

4. Best schools for math
-- Select school and average_math
-- Filter for average_math 640 or higher
-- Display from largest to smallest average_math
SELECT
    school_name,
    average_math
FROM schools
WHERE average_math >= 640
ORDER BY average_math DESC;

5. Lowest reading score
-- Find lowest average_reading

SELECT 
    MIN(average_reading) AS lowest_reading
FROM schools

6. Best writing school
-- Find the top score for average_writing
-- Group the results by school
-- Sort by max_writing in descending order
-- Reduce output to one school

SELECT
    school_name,
    MAX(average_writing) AS max_writing
FROM schools
GROUP BY school_name
ORDER BY max_writing DESC
LIMIT 1;

7. Top 10 schools
-- Calculate average_sat
-- Group by school_name
-- Sort by average_sat in descending order
-- Display the top ten results

SELECT
    school_name,
    SUM(average_math + average_reading + average_writing) AS average_SAT
FROM schools
GROUP BY school_name
ORDER BY average_sat DESC
LIMIT 10;

8. Ranking boroughs
-- Select borough and a count of all schools, aliased as num_schools
-- Calculate the sum of average_math, average_reading, and average_writing, divided by a count of all schools, aliased as average_borough_sat
-- Organize results by borough
-- Display by average_borough_sat in descending order

SELECT 
    borough,
    COUNT(*) AS num_schools,
    SUM(average_math + average_reading + average_writing) / COUNT(*)  AS average_borough_sat
FROM schools
GROUP BY borough
ORDER BY average_borough_sat DESC;

9. Brooklyn numbers
-- Select school and average_math
-- Filter for schools in Brooklyn
-- Aggregate on school_name
-- Display results from highest average_math and restrict output to five rows

WITH A AS(
    SELECT school_name,
           borough
    FROM schools
    WHERE borough = 'Brooklyn')
SELECT
    school_name,
    average_math
FROM schools
WHERE school_name IN (SELECT 
                         school_name
                      FROM A)
ORDER BY average_math DESC
LIMIT 5;
